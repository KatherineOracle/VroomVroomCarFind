**To run**

Using Heroku you can run `heroku local web`

or

With the commandline. navigate to the root of this folder and run 'npm  start' and
Open a second commandline window, navigate to the /front folder and again 'npm  start'

APOLOGIES FOR THE ERROR RONNY!!

You are right, I must have accidentally made that mistake with the port numbeer while struggling to get it working on Heroku :)
